üîÑ Recommendations -

1.  Address Sales Decline (COVID Impact):
‚óè Action: Reassess marketing strategies and focus on pandemic recovery measures to boost sales in the affected period (Jan-Jun 2020). Target regions with the greatest decline with special promotions or offers.
‚óè Rationale: Sales decline could be linked to the COVID-19 pandemic. Recovery can be aided by adapting sales strategies to the new environment, focusing on high-impact markets.

2. Enhance E-commerce Presence:
‚óè Action: Increase investment in E-commerce channels to narrow the revenue gap with Brick and Mortar stores. Focus on improving the online shopping experience, faster delivery, and promotions.
‚óè Rationale: While Brick and Mortar stores contribute the most (79.55%), E-commerce represents a smaller share (20.45%) that could be expanded to capture additional revenue streams.

3. Target High-Performing Markets:
‚óè Action: Increase targeted efforts in high-performing markets like Delhi, Mumbai, and Ahmedabad by offering exclusive deals, loyalty programs, and personalized marketing.
‚óè Rationale: These markets are contributing significantly to both revenue and profits. Strengthening engagement here can further boost sales.

4. Focus on Low-Profit Margins:
‚óè Action: Investigate and optimize operations in low-profit margin markets like Lucknow, Kanpur, and Delhi NCR. Consider pricing adjustments or cost-cutting measures to improve margins.
‚óè Rationale: Markets with low or negative profit margins should be analyzed for inefficiencies, and strategies should be put in place to improve profitability.

5. Monitor Profit Margins by Region:
‚óè Action: Continue to prioritize markets like Bhubneshwar, Hyderabad, and Chennai, where profit margins are strong, while adjusting strategies in lower-margin areas.
‚óè Rationale: Profit margins should be a key indicator for strategic focus. By allocating resources to high-margin markets, overall profitability can be boosted.

6. Boost Profitability in Negative Margin Areas:
‚óè Action: Investigate Lucknow's negative profit margin and explore cost reduction, operational efficiency, or pricing strategies to recover from the negative margin.
‚óè Rationale: A negative profit margin indicates potential issues in cost control or pricing, which should be addressed to avoid losses.
